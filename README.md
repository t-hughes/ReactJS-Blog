###ReactJS-Blog###
This is a blog app I created in ReactJS. It uses react-router to navigate to the different pages and uses the http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/ API. Users can create, read, and delete a blog post.

###Getting Started###

```
	> git clone
	> cd ReactJS-Blog
	> Navigate to src/index.js and enter anything as your API key.
	> npm install
	> npm start
```
